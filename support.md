## FAQ

### I can’t find today’s check-in
Daily Inner Mirror allows one check-in per day.  
If you already checked in today, you’ll see today’s status reflected on the main screen.

### My trend looks wrong
Trends are based on your daily selections. If you skipped days, the trend will reflect only the days you checked in.

### Can I edit a past day?
Currently, past entries may not be editable (depending on your version).  
If you need this feature, email us — it helps shape future updates.

### Does the app collect personal data?
We aim to keep data on-device and collect as little as possible.  
See details here: **[Privacy Policy](privacy.md)**

### I want to delete my data
You can delete your data from within the app (if available) or by deleting the app from your device (local data will be removed).  
If iCloud sync is enabled in your build, you may also need to disable iCloud for the app in iOS Settings.

## Feature requests
We love minimal features that make the app calmer, not bigger.  
Send requests to **support@yourdomain.com** with the subject: “Feature Request”.
